<p>The first career choice I wanted was to be a piano teacher. Honestly, I don’t really remember wanting another job, unless it was to be a cowgirl. (I grew up on a ranch and that was what I knew up to a certain point.)  I took lessons with some really wonderful teachers who were always encouraging, gently pushing, and most of all enthusiastic. When I graduated I headed to Montana State University in Billings where I received my B. A. in Piano, with an emphasis in Pedagogy. 20 years later, I’m still blessed to do what I love, share my joy music with people of all ages.</p>
