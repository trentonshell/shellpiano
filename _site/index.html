    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>The Shell Piano Studio offers both private and group lessons to students of all ages and abilities in the Northwood, Iowa area. </p>
    <p>It is my desire to not only teach my students to play the piano and to read music, but first and foremost to develop a lifelong love of music. After all, according to Johann Sebastian Bach, <blockquote>“The aim and final end of all music should be none other than the glory of God and the refreshment of the soul.”</blockquote><br> 
    <p>I want my soul refreshed forever, don’t you?</p>

    <h2>General Information</h2>

    <p><strong>Private Piano Lessons</strong> are offered weekly in 30 minute sessions for students ages 5-105 of all abilities. Practicing is highly encouraged for students to gain the most out of our weekly lessons. Also students taking private lessons should already have or be willing in the near future to acquire a suitable instrument to learn on.</p>
    <p><strong>Group Piano Lessons</strong> are offered for students who are looking to explore the keyboard in a fun group environment. No instrument? No time to actually practice? No problem! We can still make progress by meeting each week and jumping in together. These lessons are perfect for that person who wants to try it out, or perhaps just is looking for a low key alternative to traditional lessons. Classes available for beginners of all ages.</p>
    <p><strong>Little Keys Group Lessons</strong> are offered weekly for children ages 3-6. This is a beginning music maker class. We’ll learn about the keyboard, and take our time learning concepts while having a ball!</p>

    <h2>Policy</h2>

    <p>Students are expected to arrive for lessons on time with all their materials and music. Parents and siblings may sit in the waiting area, wait in their vehicle in the driveway, or run errands so long as they return to pick up their student in a timely fashion.</p>
    <p>Make up lessons are offered on a <u>very</u> limited basis for those who need to miss based on weather, illness, travel, etc. and only as my schedule allows.</p>
    <p><strong>Discontinuing lessons: </strong> Sometimes it just doesn’t work to keep taking lessons. Hopefully there is much thoughtfulness and discussion going into this. Please give a 30 day notice prior to discontinuing lessons. </p>
    <p><strong>Communication: </strong> best way to contact me is via email. Feel free to message me (Facebook) text, or I will take phone calls between the hours of 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. </p>
    <p><strong>Tuition/Fees: </strong> Tuition is due on the first lesson of the month. Payment not made by 10th of the month will result in a $15 late fee. I may be paid either with cash or check or Paypal (music2shells@gmail.com) </p>
    <p>All group rates are $60/month Aug - May  or  $300 per term (10% discount if you pay per term)</p>
    <p>Private rates are $60/month or $300 per Fall / Spring term, $120 per summer term</p> 
    <p>Group students may take private lessons through summer for June and July if they would like.</p>

    <p><strong>Materials: </strong> Students will have a method book as well as a binder of current fun pieces, technical exercises, theory pages, etc that they need to bring with to lessons each week. The teacher will supply books and print materials for students and provide a binder. <br>**There is an annual $25 materials fee </p>
  
    <h2>Weekly Schedule</h2>

    <p><strong> Private Lesson </strong>  30 minutes (15 weeks fall/15 weeks spring/10 weeks summer) 45 lessons/year</p>
    <p><strong> Little Keys Group </strong> Monday 2:00 - 2:45 or Thursdays 10:00 - 10:45 (15 weeks fall/15 spring)</p>
    <p><strong> Adventure Group </strong> Monday 3:00 - 3:45 (15 weeks fall / 15 weeks spring)</p>
    <p><strong> Blast Off Group </strong> Monday 7:00 - 7:45 (15 weeks fall / 15 weeks spring)</p>

    <p>There will be a few weeks through the year that I do not teach (holidays, vacation, etc). Your tuition covers 45 weeks of private lessons annually or 30 weeks of group lessons, which allows for this.</p> 

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>The first career choice I wanted was to be a piano teacher. Honestly, I don’t really remember wanting another job, unless it was to be a cowgirl. (I grew up on a ranch and that was what I knew up to a certain point.)  I took lessons with some really wonderful teachers who were always encouraging, gently pushing, and most of all enthusiastic. When I graduated I headed to Montana State University in Billings where I received my B. A. in Piano, with an emphasis in Pedagogy. 20 years later, I’m still blessed to do what I love, share my joy music with people of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>

    <blockquote>
    "Jodi was my piano teacher for 11 years, from second grade all the way to my graduation from high school. Jodi has the talents to know what music a student likes to play which yields excitement to learn how to play. Her passion and intellect of classics and the history of piano playing grows a student’s mind beyond the music we are learning. After learning from Jodi, I can sit down at the piano and play a wide variety of music, from classical to today’s top hits, all thanks to Mrs. Shell!"<br>
