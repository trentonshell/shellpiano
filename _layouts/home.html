    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>The Shell Piano Studio offers both private and group lessons to students of all ages and abilities in the Northwood, Iowa area. </p>
    <p>It is my desire to not only teach my students to play the piano and to read music, but first and foremost to develop a lifelong love of music. After all, according to Johann Sebastian Bach, <blockquote>“The aim and final end of all music should be none other than the glory of God and the refreshment of the soul.”</blockquote><br>
    <p>I want my soul refreshed forever, don’t you?</p>

    <h2>General Information</h2>

    <p><strong>Private Piano Lessons</strong> are offered weekly in 30 or 45 minute sessions for students ages 5-105 of all abilities. Practicing is highly encouraged for students to gain the most out of our weekly lessons. Also students taking private lessons should already have or be willing in the near future to acquire a suitable instrument to learn on.</p>
    <p> Students at intermediate or advanced level playing need more time than a 30 minute lesson allows. These students are encouraged to take weekly 45 minute lessons. </p>
    <p><strong>Buddy Lessons </strong> are available for siblings as well as friends who enjoy a more social approach to lessons. In buddy lessons we will take a full hour and have 20 minutes of playing together, 10 minutes of games together and 15 minutes one on one. This gives parents the opportunity to leave students for an hour. </p>
    <p><strong>Group Piano Lessons</strong> are offered for students who are looking to explore the keyboard in a fun group environment. These lessons are perfect for that person who wants to try it out, or perhaps just is looking for a low key alternative to traditional lessons.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><a href="/documents/LittleKeys.pdf">Little Keys Group Lessons</a></strong> are offered weekly for children ages 3-6. This is a beginning music maker class. We’ll learn about the keyboard, and take our time learning concepts while having a ball!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong><a href="/documents/IgnitePoster.pdf">Ignite Group Lessons</a></strong> are available for beginners of all ages, offered in 6 week camps during the summer.</p>

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>

    <blockquote>
    "Jodi was my piano teacher for 11 years, from second grade all the way to my graduation from high school. Jodi has the talents to know what music a student likes to play which yields excitement to learn how to play. Her passion and intellect of classics and the history of piano playing grows a student’s mind beyond the music we are learning. After learning from Jodi, I can sit down at the piano and play a wide variety of music, from classical to today’s top hits, all thanks to Mrs. Shell!"
    ~ David

    <blockquote>
    "Two of my three children had taken piano lessons from a previous teacher.  Jodi was able to identify where their level was and sparked a desire in them to want to play the piano more.  Practicing no longer felt like practicing but having fun making music and learning new songs in the process.  She has allowed all my children to learn at their own pace and each child has shown tremendous growth over the last year.  She has a true gift of teaching and this has allowed her to share her passion for piano and music with others."
    ~ Sarah

    <blockquote>
      "My girls have taken lessons with Jodi for about 6 years.  They have always enjoyed her teaching and she has been able to adjust to their individual learning styles.  Her lessons are a valuable part of their education."

    <blockquote>
      "Jodi was my daughter’s first piano teacher. At first my daughter was very unsure of herself and her ability to actually learn to play the piano, but within about 2 lessons with Jodi, her confidence soared!! She has not slowed down since."
